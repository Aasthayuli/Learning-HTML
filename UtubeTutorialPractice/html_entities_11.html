      but actually, we don't use this way to give space. instead we use css for
      styling as padding and margin.
      <p>paragraph is written using tag: &lt;p&gt;.</p>

      <p>pound is written like this &pound;</p>
      <!-- shows the sign of pound -->
      <p>copyright is written like this: &copy;</p>

      <!-- to know these types of entities, google html entities refence. -->
      <p>fraction could be written like this:&frac12;</p>

      <p>Empty character can be written like this:&#8203;</p>
      prints nothing but an empty space.
