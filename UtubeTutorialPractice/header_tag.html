          The Google logo appears in numerous settings to identify the search
          engine company. Google has used several logos over its history, with
          the first logo created by Sergey Brin using GIMP. A revised logo
          debuted on September 1, 2015. The previous logo, with slight
          modifications between 1999 and 2013, was designed by Ruth Kedar, with
          a wordmark based on the Catull font, an old style serif typeface
          designed by Gustav Jaeger for the Berthold Type Foundry in 1982. The
          company also includes various modifications or humorous features, such
          as modifications of their logo for use on holidays, birthdays of
          famous people, and major events, such as the Olympics. These special
          logos, some designed by Dennis Hwang, have become known as Google
          Doodles.
